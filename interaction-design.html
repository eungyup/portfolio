                <h2>Welcome to my Interaction Design Project!</h2>
                <p>
                    At Interaction Design class at the University of Michigan, I have worked on a website prototype for Asian seniors in the US, who are first-generation immigrants and who want to learn the computer beyond the basics. The website provides six key features to users. The users can (1) take pre-made computer courses, (2) connect and learn with their family and friends, (3) translate the texts and audios in their preferred languages, (4) save their notes, (5) use their public card numbers to log in to their main user pages, and (6) update their health condition on “My Profile” page.

                <h2>Below are some works from the interaction design project.</h2>
                <div class="grid_container">
                    <div id="hi_fi_text">
                        <h3>Hi-fi Prototype</h3>
                        <div class="project_text">
                            <p>I created a Hi-fi prototyping using the Sketch app and Invision App. There were 100 screens to cover most of the user flows.
                                As a designer, my philosophy for the project is to make a website in a way seniors can easily interact with it and overcome the language and age barrier. 
                                Based on my philosophy, I (1) used at least 18 px text font size (most of them were 20 px or bigger) <a href="https://learnui.design/blog/mobile-desktop-website-font-size-guidelines.html" target="_blank">although the normal font size of a typical website was 16 px (Kennedy, 2018)</a>,
                                (2) used a consistent Arial, a San Serif font, because <a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/05/designing-for-senior-citizens-organizing-your-work-schedule.php" target="_blank">seniors could read San Serif font easily on the website (Six, 2010) </a>, 
                                (3) didn’t use yellow and green color except a green available icon because I used blue as a main color of the website, and for seniors, <a href="https://discoveryeye.org/print-and-web-design-for-older-adults/" target="_blank">it was difficult to differentiate blue, yellow, and green if they were lined up closely (DeRemer, 2015)</a>, and 
                            (4) put a translation function icon in every page on the bottom so that the users could translate the page wherever they were.

                        <h3>Low-fi Prototype</h3>
                        <div class="project_text">
                            <p>Before I created the hi-fi prototype, I worked on a low-fi prototype (paper prototype) so that I caught any potentials problems before developing the complex hi-fi prototype. Below is a summary of what I especially focused on the paper prototype.  
                            <ul>
                                <li>Put a big translation icon on the right bottom of every page so that users can translate the page fast and easily.</li>
                                <li>Used a big checkmark to show who was available at the moment on the “Connect & Learn” Page. </li>
                                <li>Used a star icon with a facial emoji next to important people to indicate how they are doing on the “Connect & Learn” page.</li>
                                <li>Made the “Remove” button with a red border when a user clicks “Remove” on the “Connect & Learn” page. </li>
                                <li>Put the “Undo” icon for users who didn’t mean to remove a person on the “Connect & Learn” page. </li>

                                Eunhae came to Michigan from South Korea in 2017 when her daughter invited her to live with her family in Troy, MI after Eunhae’s husband passed away 2 years ago. Since then, she has lived with her daughter’s family in Troy, MI. 

                                She has two daughters and one son. The older daughter lives in Troy MI, and the younger daughter studies in Australia. Her son is working in Seattle, WA after he got a Bachelor’s degree from the University of Washington.
                                
                                Eunhae is a very family-oriented and social person. She thinks that her family and her friends are the most important asset in her life. She always wants to get in touch with them.
                                
                                She took a computer 101 class from a public library in Korea. However, she only learned the basics like how to turn on the computer and how to open a folder. She wants to learn some computer tools like Skype, so that she can communicate with her family and friends more often.

                                In 2003, Hiroshi came to Farmington Hills, MI from Japan with his wife due to his job relocation. He used to work at Panasonic, a Japanese Electric company, in Osaka, Japan for a long time before he got relocated to Panasonic Automotive, a Panasonic branch, in Farmington Hills, MI 16 years ago. 

                                Since then, he had worked at Panasonic Automotive as a senior engineer until he retired last year. His job was mainly evaluating and testing some formulas of new electric design. Because most of his colleges were Japanese/English bilingual, he didn’t need to speak English a lot. 
                                
                                He learned how to use some basic computer tools like MS Word and MS Excel from his previous company . But he wants to learn other computer tools beyond the basic, so that he can share his experience and knowledge with others. In addition, he wants to learn a graphic design to help his friend’s business.
